            From the experiences from our last exercise and the expectations for the final project, one thing that I’ve been thinking of was the possibilities of implementing animations to codes running on websites with art designs and techniques. Animation has always been something that artists use for display most of the time, in which some interactions can bring the entire art piece into a brand new level.

        <p style="color:rgb(97, 97, 97)">
            Besides the possibilities of implementing user interactions to animations, another huge use of websites are the click games (where animations could also be involved according to the developers’ intentions). Growing up with the rise and developments of computer games, all of my early memories about computers have been these online clicking games of a short story or a competition between the player and the computer generated AI. Nowadays, such games are mostly out of our sights as a stepping stone for the newly developed video games, but can still be showing some innovative concepts of art design or of game design in an old-schooled way of demonstration.

            Brainstorming for the final project, I’m hoping to introduce a decent amount of user interaction in a web-based media, showing the special characteristics of websites and coding while making art as the focus or the core of demonstration. </p>
